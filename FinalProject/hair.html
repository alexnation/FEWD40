			And no matter what kind of hair you have, all the product and all the tools in the world can't help you if you don't have a good haircut from an expert stylist.

			Your first task is to find the best hairstylist that you can afford - find someone with fantastic hair and get their stylist's number.

			Think about how much work you're willing to put in, and be realistic.

			For example, I get my hair cut once or twice a year and have super low maintenance balyage that requires no upkeep at all. This is for two reasons:
				1. I can't afford $100+ for a haircut that often.
				2. Ditto color - balyage can be $180 and up.

			Now that you have the basics down, let's talk tools and product.

			Tools:
			The best hair dryer:
			The best flat iron:
			The best curling wand:

			Product:

				Let's keep this section short.
				Get yourself three everyday products:
					1. A good BB cream to even out skin.
					2. Mascara.
					3. A pretty longwear lip color.

				If you want to know more, there are a zillion YouTube videos and even more Pinterest posts on how to "rock a cat-eye" or "up your lip game". This blog is not about that - we are busy girls who just want to master the basics!
