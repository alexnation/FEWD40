			Let's say you know you SHOULD go to the gym more often, but life gets in the way.
			<br>
			I've got great news for you - if you eat right and do the right workouts, you can work out only 1-3 times per week.
			<br>
			
			Start in the comfort of your home - check out my two favorite fitness gurus - they give you routines to do in the comfort of your home. Get a set of dumbbells from Target and get to it (and don't tell me you don't have space, if you can clear 2 square feet around you, that's all you need).

				It's time to venture outside the house for some fun classes!
			<br>
				If you can afford a gym membership, ClassPass is fantastic - you can try all different types of classes and gyms.
			<br>
				Last thing on this topic - if you're going to buy a gym membership, buy one you'll use. I used to belong to a low-priced gym chain, but I never went - it was crowded and dirty. I now go to a gym that costs a bit more but is worth every penny - I go 3-5 times/week for the incredible classes and amenities. It's an investment in my health and subsequent happiness. 
			<br>
				At this point, I don't even exercise for weight loss. I do it to shake off the cobwebs and execute in all other areas of my life.

				Let's get one thing out of the way: Most nutrition advice is terrible, mostly because it advocates eating more sugar than anyone needs (and sugar is hiding in absolutely everything). 
				<br>
				
				That being said, I'm a fan of Michael Pollan's perspective on the matter: "Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants". 
				<br>
				If you're looking to lose weight, check out the slow carb and ketogenic diets (both of which advocate little to no sugar).
				<br>
				Paleo and Whole 30 are also fantastic - they follow the "eat real food" school of thought.
