			<br>
			If you're starting from square one with a wardrobe, I must emphasize one thing:
			<br>
			Adopt a uniform - it'll make getting dressed so much easier.
			<br>
			My uniform is either a dress and heels or skinny jeans & booties. I know that I hate suits of any kind and don't wear brown, ever. 
			<br>
			I have about 3-5 different outfit silhouettes that I wear over and over again. Learn what works for your body type and tailor, tailor, tailor!

			<p id="hair2">
				Given some thought to your uniform? Good. Now it's time to put your look in the hands of an expert.
			<br>
				Pick up the phone and call a Nordstrom personal stylist.
			<br>
				Don't worry, you don't have to buy anything. They will ask you a few questions (including budget) and pull a room together for you. You can buy one thing, everything, or nothing at all (and of course use their amazing return policy). This service is absolutely free, saves you a ton of time, and is Nordstrom's best kept secret.

				If you're brand new to accessories, you need options, and options come in the form of subscription boxes. Here is all you need:
				<br>
				
				1. Rent jewelry from my friends at <a href="www.rocksbox.com">Rocksbox</a> 
				<br>
				2. Obsessed with handbags? ME TOO! You need <a href="">Bag, Borrow, & Steal</a> - pretty self-explanatory. 
				<br>
				3.  You can also rent watches, if you're into that: <a href="">WATCHES</a>
				<br>
				If you're ready for some real OG fashion bravery, check out Stitch Fix or Rent the Runway's Unlimited Program (also, Rent the Runway for an evening gown or cocktail dress you'll only wear once is everything).
